### Meetup #1, March 5

Last night I went to my first meetup: [Raleigh Project Night](http://www.meetup.com/tripython/events/165847452/)
through tripython. The event was essentially just a place 
to get together with other Python developers and talk about the projects you're working on. It was held in a trendy 
startup on UNC's campus called WebAssign (apparently it's an online academic resource like sakai).

 I went with Josh Rice, my partner for the final project. We worked on our project and chatted with the developers. 
 It was a pretty laid-back environment... except that a tech recruiter crashed the event trying to hire developers. 
 I think that must be a common problem with these meetups, I've seen a lot of warnings on meetup descriptions asking 
 those recruiters not to abuse their events. But overall, I had a good time; I'm considering going again next month.
 
 
### Meetup #2, March 6

Tonight I attended my second meetup, [Tech Beers](http://www.meetup.com/RDU-Tech-Beers/) at Bombshell Brewery in Holly Springs. 
It was mostly software engineers, I was the only Web developer. But we chatted about various nerdy topics: C++, 
a new mobile device that's almost all WiFi (http://bandwidth.com/, very cool), Apple's new [iBeacon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon), 
[Google's self-driving cars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdgQpa1pUUE).... and a few less-nerdy, more-alcoholic topics like 
Topo's disappointing line of sub-par liquor.

It was overall a good time, I think I'll go next month and might just keep going even after this class ends.


### Meetup #3, April 10

Last night I attended my third meetup at Lynnwood Grill & Brewery in Raleigh, [Tech Beers](http://www.meetup.com/RDU-Tech-Beers/events/170013472/). 
The turnout was pretty good, there were nine of us. We talked about various tech geeky topics: [Google Fiber](https://fiber.google.com/about/), 
[Heartbleed](http://lifehacker.com/what-the-heartbleed-security-bug-means-for-you-1560801201), [Pebble watches](https://getpebble.com/)... 
and Monty Python. 

I was really surprised and excited to learn that one of the guys had been working for Swype (http://www.swype.com/) since its beginning. 
I've been an avid Swype user for years, so it was really cool to talk to him about how the company mines the data they collect from each 
user's physical movements on the keyboard as well as language patterns. He mentioned he worked primarily on Swype's servers, and that the 
biggest problem they face right now is figuring out how to store the immense amounts of data they're collecting. 
If you have an Android phone and you don't have Swype, you're missing out.

### Meta-analysis

Overall, I had pretty good experiences at all of the meetups I attended. I don't think I would go to another tripython meetup. The atmosphere was
kind of reminiscient of a high school study hall, and the most talkative person there was just trying to sell his startup idea and recruit 
Web developers, which became awkward pretty quickly.

I really enjoyed both of the Tech Beers meetups, and I'm planning on going again in May. In both sessions, it was mostly developers who worked from
home and were making an effort to network and be social with people who shared their professional interests. I learned a lot, had fun,
and met interesting people. Aside from being generally enjoyable, I could see some of the contacts I've made there eventually coming in handy 
if I wanted to move to a new job. Yay, networking!
